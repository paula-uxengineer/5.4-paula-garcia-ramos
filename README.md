# MongoDB-Queries sprint5.4
>This exercise focuses on learning to perform queries with MongoDB. Given a set of restaurant data, queries are performed on the MongoDB database.

## Getting Started

### Requirements:

- MongoDB: We will use this NoSQL database, so it needs to be installed and running.
- MongoDB Compass: We can verify and execute the queries using this GUI tool for MongoDB.

### File Structure:

```
src/
|
└── collection
|     └── restaurants.js
|
└── queries
     └── queries.js
```

```queries.js```: This file contains all the MongoDB queries.
```restaurants.js```: This file contains the db collection.

## Evaluation Criteria:

### ⭐️ Level 1
You will certify your level 1 if you build 17 correct queries.

### ⭐️⭐️ Level 2
You will achieve level 2 if you build between 17 and 25 correct queries.
	
### ⭐️⭐️⭐️ Level 3
If you manage to build correctly more than 25 correct queries!!!

## Submission Requirements:
Send the URL to a repository containing the solution:

- Each query should be delivered in a separate .js file.
- In each file, each query should be on a single line (regardless of its length).
- Optionally, you can also upload an unobfuscated .js file with annotations as you see fit.
